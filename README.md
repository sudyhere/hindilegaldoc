In the current situation, legal systems around the world are facing a growing backlog of cases, which highlights the critical need for innovative solutions. This challenge is especially important in populous countries like India, where the legal landscape is characterized by large volumes of legal documents and limited resources for effective processing.
Recognizing this urgent need, this article presents the Hindi Legal Document Warehouse (HLDC), an unprecedented dataset having more than 912,000 structured legal documents in Hindi. This dataset marks an important step towards addressing the scarcity of resources for analyzing legal documents in Hindi. The Indian judicial system, like many others around the world, faces an increasing number of cases, leading to delays, inefficiencies and increased pressure on judicial resources. It is in this context that HLDC has proven to be an invaluable asset. By offering a wide range of legal documents in Hindi, it creates a strong foundation for the development of complex natural language processing (NLP) models and automated systems. These systems have the potential to revolutionize the processing, analysis and access to legal information, thereby contributing to the swift and fair administration of justice.
